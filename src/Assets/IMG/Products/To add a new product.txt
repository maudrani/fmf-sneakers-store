1- Set the names of the images with this schema: 

    "name-of-the-product" + "-" + image number of the product ".webp".

    convertion: "custom-sneaker-1.webp"  will result on "custom sneaker" "image1".

2- Add each .webp resized image of the product to its folder (full-size, x70, x50, x25, x15)
3- The program will automatically detect the name of the images and create a single object with the name of the product 
and the array of images.

    example:

	input: "custom-sneaker-1.webp", "custom-sneaker-2.webp", "custom-sneaker-3.webp" in the folders.
	output: 
		{
		   name: custom sneaker,
		   images: {
			      full-size: ["./full-size/custom-sneaker-1.webp", "./full-size/custom-sneaker-2.webp" ...],
			      x70: ["./X70/custom-sneaker-1.webp", "./full-size/custom-sneaker-2.webp" ...],
 			      x50: ...
			   }
		}
